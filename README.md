## ⚙️ How the Project Works

1. **HTML Structure**: The dragon's layout and positioning are defined in the `index.html` file.
2. **CSS Styling & Animation**: The `styles.css` file contains all styles related to the dragon's appearance and behavior, including keyframe animations that bring the dragon to life.
3. **JavaScript Interaction**: The `script.js` file is responsible for handling user interactions, like hover effects or click-based animations.

<br>

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Complex CSS Animations**: Using CSS3 keyframes and transforms, the dragon performs complex animations such as flying, tail movements, and color transitions.
- **User Interaction**: The dragon reacts to user inputs, such as hovering over its body or clicking specific areas to trigger unique animations.
- **Customizable Design**: Easily update the dragon's appearance and behavior by tweaking the CSS and JavaScript logic.

<br>

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- **Fire-Breathing Animation**: Add more complex animations, such as the dragon breathing fire.
- **Sound Effects**: Incorporate sound to enhance the user experience (e.g., dragon roars or fire sound).
- **Additional Interactions**: More interactive elements where the dragon reacts to clicks, keyboard inputs, or mobile gestures.

## 🎨 Customization Tips

Feel free to personalize this project by modifying the following:

- **Change Dragon Design**: You can swap out the dragon’s image for another design by updating the image file in the `assets/` folder.
- **Adjust Animation Speed**: Modify the CSS keyframe duration values to control how fast the dragon animates.
- **Play with Colors**: Update the CSS color values to give the dragon a unique look.
